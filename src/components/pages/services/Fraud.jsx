            What Is Fraud Investigation?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Fraud is a widespread problem that can severely impact businesses
            and individuals. It includes various dishonest activities aimed at
            gaining money through deceitful means, such as embezzlement, tax
            avoidance and evasion, identity theft, and cybercrimes. These
            fraudulent acts can result in significant financial losses and harm
            an organisation’s reputation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Fraud investigation services play a vital role in combating fraud.
            These services involve carefully reviewing digital records, witness

            activities. They help identify the risks and ensure that businesses
            and individuals are protected from financial harm.
