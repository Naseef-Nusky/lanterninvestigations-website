          The internet is not a secure medium. However, we have put in place
          various security procedures as set out in this policy. Firewalls are
          used to block unauthorised traffic to the servers, and the actual
          servers are located in a secure location which can only be accessed by
          authorised personnel. We also keep your information confidential. Our
          internal procedures cover the storage, access, and disclosure of your
          information.

          within this website, you and they consent to its use as set out in
          this Privacy Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the

          we use it at all times. Continued use of the service will signify that

          The internet is a global medium and your information may therefore be
          transferred outside the European Economic Area en route. By submitting
          your information, you consent to any such transfer. We may pass your
          personal information to other companies for processing on our behalf.
          Some of these companies may be based outside Europe in countries which
          may not have laws to protect your personal information, but in all
          cases we will ensure that it is kept securely and only used for the
          purposes for which you provided it. If you do not want us to have
          personal information about you, please do not submit it to us.
